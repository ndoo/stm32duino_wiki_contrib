> [!WARNING]
> Arduino boards provide ICSP connector used by several Arduino shields for SPI signal: MISO/MOSI/SCK. STM32 boards do not have this ICSP connector, so this requires to manually wire those SPI signals to the desired pin (mainly: D11 to D13)

## Built-in (delivered with the core package)

* CMSIS_DSP: see usage example [here](../blob/main/libraries/CMSIS_DSP/examples/arm_sin_cos_example_f32/arm_sin_cos_example_f32.ino)
* EEPROM: follow the official [EEPROM](https://docs.arduino.cc/learn/built-in-libraries/eeprom/) API
* IWatchdog: see [here](../blob/main/libraries/IWatchdog/README.md)
* Servo: follow the official [Servo](https://docs.arduino.cc/libraries/servo/) API
* SoftwareSerial: follow the official [SoftwareSerial](https://docs.arduino.cc/learn/built-in-libraries/software-serial/) API.<br>
  It uses an **hardware timer**. Interrupt is triggered at a `frequency = Baudrate * OVERSAMPLE` (by default _3*baudrate_) to handle RX as well as TX transmissions.
  This impacts CPU load specially at high baudrate.
* SPI: follow the official [SPI](https://docs.arduino.cc/language-reference/en/functions/communication/SPI/) API
* Wire (I2C): follow the official [Wire](https://docs.arduino.cc/language-reference/en/functions/communication/Wire/) API
